Welcome to AISBench Benchmark Tool English Tutorial ✨
=======================================

🌏 Introduction
-----------------------------

AISBench Benchmark is a model evaluation tool built on `OpenCompass <https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass>`_, compatible with OpenCompass's configuration system, dataset structure, and model backend implementation, while extending support for service-based models.

Currently, AISBench supports two major types of inference task evaluation scenarios:

🔍 Accuracy Evaluation: Supports accuracy verification of service-based models and local models on various question-answering and reasoning benchmark datasets.

🚀 Performance Evaluation: Supports the assessment of latency and throughput for service-oriented models, and enables extreme performance testing under stress test scenarios.
