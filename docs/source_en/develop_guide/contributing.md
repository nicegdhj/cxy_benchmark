We use GitHub Issues to track tasks and issues. Before starting to contribute, we recommend:

1. Check existing [Issues](https://github.com/AISBench/benchmark/issues) to understand current work priorities
2. For new features or major changes, it is recommended to create an Issue for discussion first
3. For bug fixes, you can directly submit a Pull Request

## Development

### Environment Setup

1. **Python Version Requirements**: Only supports Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12

2. **Clone Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AISBench/benchmark.git
cd benchmark/
```

3. **Create Development Environment** (recommended to use Conda):

```bash
conda create --name ais_bench_dev python=3.10 -y
conda activate ais_bench_dev
```

4. **Install Development Dependencies**:

```bash
# Install core dependencies
pip3 install -e ./ --use-pep517

# Install development dependencies (if needed)
pip3 install -r requirements/api.txt

```

### Code Structure

AISBench adopts a registry-based plugin architecture:

- **Core Plugin Modules**: Located in the `ais_bench/benchmark/` directory

- **Configuration Files**: Located in the `ais_bench/benchmark/configs/` directory
  - `models/`: Model configurations
  - `datasets/`: Dataset configurations
  - `summarizers/`: Result summarizer configurations

- **Plugin System**: Supports extending functionality through entry_point mechanism, see [Plugin Development Guide](../../../plugin_examples/README.md) for details

### Development Workflow

1. **Create Branch**:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

2. **Develop**: Write code, add tests, update documentation

3. **Commit Changes**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new feature description"
```

4. **Push and Create Pull Request**

## Code Checking (Linting)

Before submitting code, please ensure the code complies with the project's code standards:

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) code style guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Line length recommended not to exceed 120 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Formatting Tools

It is recommended to use the following tools for code formatting:

```bash
# Use black for code formatting (if project is configured)
black ais_bench/

# Use isort for import sorting (if project is configured)
isort ais_bench/
```

### Static Checking

Run basic Python syntax checking before submitting:

```bash
python -m py_compile your_file.py
```

## Documentation

### Documentation Structure

Project documentation is located in the `docs/` directory:

- `source_zh_cn/`: Chinese documentation
- `source_en/`: English documentation

### Documentation Writing Standards

1. **Markdown Format**: Use Markdown to write documentation
2. **Chinese Documentation**: Use simplified Chinese, language should be concise and clear
3. **Code Examples**: Provide complete runnable code examples
4. **Link Checking**: Ensure all links are valid

### Updating Documentation

- When adding new features, please synchronously update related documentation
- When modifying APIs, please update corresponding documentation
- When adding dataset or model configurations, please provide README.md instructions

## Testing

### Test Structure

Test files are located in the `tests/` directory:

- `UT/`: Unit tests (integrated into CI)

### Running Tests

Install test-related dependencies

```bash
# Run all tests
python tests/run_tests.py

# Run all tests with multiple processes
python tests/run_tests.py -p 4 # 4 processes

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/UT/test_example.py
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Test functionality of single functions or classes
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between multiple components
- **Test Naming**: Use `test_` prefix to name test functions
- **Test Coverage**: New features should include corresponding test cases, target coverage not less than 80%

## DCO and Signed-off-by

AISBench uses the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) to ensure the legality of contributions.

### How to Sign Commits

Add a `Signed-off-by` line to the commit message:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: Add new feature"
```

The `-s` parameter will automatically add the `Signed-off-by` line.

### Signed-off-by Format

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

2. You agree to release the contribution under Apache License 2.0

## PR Title and Classification

### Title Format

Use the following format:

```
[type][scope]<subject>
```

Where:
- `[type]`: Commit type, see type descriptions below
- `[scope]`: Affected scope (optional), such as models, datasets, docs, etc.
- `<subject>`: Brief descriptive title

### Types

- `[feat]`: New feature
- `[fix]`: Bug fix
- `[docs]`: Documentation update
- `[style]`: Code format adjustment (does not affect functionality)
- `[refactor]`: Code refactoring
- `[test]`: Test related
- `[chore]`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes
